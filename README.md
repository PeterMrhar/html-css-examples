# HTML & CSS Examples – Companion to the Book

This repository contains practical examples from the book:

**HTML & CSS for Beginners: The Practical Guide – Create Beautiful, Responsive Websites from Scratch — Even If You've Never Written a Line of Code**

Each folder (e.g. `Code-8-13`, `Code-8-14`, …) contains one example with its own `index.html`. These are meant to be explored, modified, and used as learning tools while following the chapters in the book.

## How to Use

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open any `index.html` file in your browser to see the example.
3. Optionally, edit the HTML or CSS to experiment and learn.

## Special Note on Code-25-x (Node.js Examples)

The folders under `Code-25` contain **Node.js server-side examples**, which require Node.js and a terminal to run. Instructions are included in each subfolder.
