<h1>The Story of the Enchanted Keyboard</h1>

<p>
  Once upon a time, in a quiet village surrounded by pine forests, there lived an old programmer who could make machines speak. 
  Every line of code he wrote carried a bit of magic. The villagers believed his keyboard was enchanted, and even the wind paused when he typed.
